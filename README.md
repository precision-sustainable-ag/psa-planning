The psa-planning repo is the place where big picture Precision Sustainable Ag (PSA) planning milestones and epics are stored. These are then visualized in the PSA Planning GitHub Project linked here https://github.com/orgs/precision-sustainable-ag/projects/5.

## Breakdown of item subtypes

There are 3 main types of planning items, 2 of which are stored in this repo. 
1. Tasks: The smallest planning unit. These items do not live in this repo. Instead, they are spread out amongst lots of repositories in the PSA organization. A task is an item taht is scope to be assigned and completed by a single person. It has all of the technical details needed to complete it.
2. Epics: An epic is a collection of tasks. It is a larger unit of planning that links to multiple tasks in external repos. It does not go into the same level of technical detail, and is typically filled out by a project manager or a tehc lead. All epics live in this repository.
3. Milestones: These are the largest planning unit. Each milestone is a collection of epics. These are items that may take months or years to complete. All milestones live in this repository.

## Advantages of this system

1. It allows for a roadmap to be created for PSA as a whole and viewed in one place instead of fractured project management tools across multiple teams.
2. It can directly link out to tasks in external repos, making it very easy to go from the top level all the way done to a specific task's conversation and documentation.
3. You can see who the owner of an epic is quickly and easily on the roadmap.
